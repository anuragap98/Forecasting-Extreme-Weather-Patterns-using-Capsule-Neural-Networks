This repository explores the application of Capsule Neural Networks (CapsNets) for forecasting extreme weather events such as heat waves and cold spells.

**Background:**

* Extreme weather events, like heat waves and cold spells, have significant societal and economic impacts. 
* Accurate and timely forecasting of these events is crucial for disaster preparedness, public health, and agricultural planning.
* Traditional forecasting methods often rely on complex statistical models or deep learning architectures like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).

**Project Objective:**

* Investigate the potential of CapsNets for predicting the occurrence and intensity of extreme weather events.
* Compare the performance of CapsNets with other deep learning models (e.g., RNNs, CNNs) on relevant meteorological datasets.
* Explore the interpretability of CapsNet predictions to gain insights into the underlying weather patterns.

**Methodology:**

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
   * Gather historical weather data (temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, etc.) from reliable sources.
   * Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values and outliers.
   * Engineer relevant features, such as daily temperature anomalies and weather indices.

2. **Model Development:**
   * Implement a CapsNet architecture suitable for time-series forecasting.
   * Train and evaluate the CapsNet model on the prepared dataset.
   * Compare the performance of the CapsNet model with other deep learning models (e.g., RNNs, CNNs).

3. **Evaluation and Analysis:**
   * Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, mean squared error).
   * Analyze the predictions and identify patterns in the model's output.
   * Investigate the interpretability of CapsNet predictions to understand the model's decision-making process.

4. **Results and Discussion:**
   * Present the results of the model evaluation and comparisons.
   * Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of CapsNets for extreme weather forecasting.
   * Analyze the implications of the findings and propose potential future research directions.

**Technologies:**

* Python
* TensorFlow/PyTorch
* Scikit-learn
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
